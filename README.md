# Mahjong-Basic-Winning-Hand
An assistant for any mahjong player to check if they have a winning hand

## Problem Statement
People where I live (Singapore) are too busy and can only play mahjong during CNY. Sometimes you forget if your hand is a winning hand and you take the time to look online on winning hands and amount of profits.

Disclaimer: Just for the lols. Will use the Singapore version of mahjong. 

## Solution
A web application that allows you to take a picture/upload your picture and checks if the hand is a winning hand.

## Complexities
Some tiles might be placed shown which might make it more difficult.

A way to solve this is to have 3 separate pictures.

1. Main hand
2. Faced up hand
3. Flowers and Animals

## Tech Stack
Undecided lol.
